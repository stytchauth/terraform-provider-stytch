# stytch Provider

Interact with Stytch to configure your workspace, including projects, redirect URLs, email templates and more.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configuration-based authentication
provider "stytch" {
  workspace_key_id     = "workspace-key-prod-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  workspace_key_secret = "***"
}

# The provider can also be configured via environment variables
# Use the STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_ID and STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_SECRET environment variables
# This is the recommended way to configure the provider.
provider "stytch" {}
