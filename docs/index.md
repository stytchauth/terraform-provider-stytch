# stytch Provider

Interact with Stytch's [Programmatic Workspace Actions API](https://stytch.com/docs/workspace-management/pwa/overview) to configure your workspace, including projects, redirect URLs, email templates and more. 
 See migration instructions from v1 to v3 in the [migration guide](https://github.com/stytchauth/terraform-provider-stytch/blob/main/v1_to_v3_changes.md).

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    stytch = {
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/stytchauth/stytch"
      version = "TODO" # Find the latest version at https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stytchauth/stytch/latest
    }
  }
}

# Configuration-based authentication
provider "stytch" {
  workspace_key_id     = "workspace-key-prod-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  workspace_key_secret = "***"
}

# The provider can also be configured via environment variables
# Use the STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_ID and STYTCH_WORKSPACE_KEY_SECRET environment variables
